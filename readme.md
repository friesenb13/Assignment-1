# Pandemic Extension

This chrome extension replaces the word "pandemic" with "panoramic", in reference to people jokingly calling the pandemic different “p” words. The extension also replaces existing images on the page with funny gifs and images to create some humour and relatability of the panic that people are feeling during the pandemic. The gifs are courtesy of Giphy, where I found lots of gifs from the show Friends that perfectly captured my feelings towards the pandemic. Originally, I was going to just replace images with images, and have a popup button to add the gifs, but wasn’t able to figure that out, and also liked the implementation of replacing the existing webpage images with gifs instead. The font also changes for the headings to a fun font. I wanted to change just the word “panoramic” to the different font, but couldn’t figure out how to. The last touch for the extension is the background change which is activated by buttons within the popup. The simple background change brightens up the page making it feel happier and more optimistic. The extension works on every internet page, but the gifs/images often don’t show up as intended on many webpages. Therefore, the CDC page linked below is my recommended page to view to best see how my extension functions.
